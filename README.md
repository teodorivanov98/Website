## 🌐 Live Demo

Click the badge above to explore the fully functional **live deployment** of my personal portfolio site, hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3** & **Django Framework** – for powerful, dynamic back-end functionality
- **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5** – for clean, responsive UI
- **JavaScript** – for interactive features like games
- **SQLite** – lightweight development database
- **Render** – cloud hosting platform for automatic deployment from GitHub

---

## 🤔 Why Use Render for Deployment?

Since my project is built with **Django**, a **dynamic Python web framework**, it can't be deployed on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Render supports:

- Running dynamic server-side code (like Django views and forms)
- Python environments with WSGI servers (like Gunicorn)
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Running management commands like `collectstatic` or database migrations

---

## 📬 Contact Form Note

To handle form submissions and email notifications, my project integrates SMTP settings securely with Render’s environment variables. This avoids exposing sensitive email credentials in code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Central profile photo & responsive navbar
- Interactive games (Tic Tac Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Dice Roll)
- Sections: Experience, Education, Certificates, Hobbies
- Working contact form with email notifications
- Dynamic backgrounds for each section
