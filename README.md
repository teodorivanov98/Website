## 🌐 Live Demo

Click the badge above to explore the **live deployment** of my personal portfolio, hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

🕒 **Note:** It may take **a few seconds to a couple of minutes** for the site to wake up on first load. This is normal behavior for free-tier hosting on Render.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3** & **Django Framework** – for powerful, dynamic back-end functionality
- **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5** – for clean, responsive UI
- **JavaScript** – for interactive features like games
- **SQLite** – lightweight development database
- **Render** – cloud hosting platform for automatic deployment from GitHub

## 🤔 Why Use Render for Deployment?

Since this project is built with **Django**, a **dynamic Python web framework**, it requires a server capable of:

- Running Python back-end code (e.g., Django views, email handling)
- Hosting WSGI apps (e.g., via Gunicorn)
- Managing dynamic routing and database interactions
